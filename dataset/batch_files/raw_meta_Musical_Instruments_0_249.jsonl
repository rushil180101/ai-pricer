Audio hub equals flexibility - true to their name Audio hubs perform with ease in any amplification application - keyboards, electronic drums, vocals, acoustic and electric string instruments as well as playback are all handled with ease. Designed with flexibility in mind the AH80 can accommodate a variety of input options such as XLR, Jack or RCAs. Two independent channels with a dedicated three band EQ on each to give you plenty of tonal possibilities. An On-board Digital Delay with Feedback, Time & Level controls with individual channel assigns gives you the ability to add a bit of character to each of the channel inputs, an AUX CD input - 3.5mm stereo jack and finally a DI out completes the front panel features. Add to this an FX loop on the rear panel and you have every base covered. Housing a 1  10 custom driver and an HF horn, the AH80 pumps out 80 watts RMS. Audio hubs sound great - they are powerful and true - what you put in you get out, but louder, much louder. They sound clean and clear and should you wish to, the onboard EQ s are powerful enough to dial out difference from venue to venue, meaning you get the best sound every time, all the time.

Powered by 6L6 tubes, the MT 15 has a large, bold sound, so you can dig in heavy with rhythms but also get singing lead tones out of one amp. Whether recording, practicing, writing, or playing a small room, this amp has everything you need. The MT 15s design started with heavier players in mind, but in the end, it has a lot to offer players of all genres. Like the PRS Archon amplifier, the MT 15 features five gain stages before the Master for full, lush distortion. The gain channel gets big, chunky tone with massive, tight low end, but it never loses its articulate note definition or great lead tone. The clean channel is bright and chimney, good with chords and fingerstyle playing  whether with a pic or not. The clean channel also features a push pull boost control that adds a little overdrive for old school crunch. No matter what tone you dial in, the MT 15 stays balanced across the spectrum with a sweet, smooth tone that wont bite your head off. Additional features include an effects loop and bias adjusters that are accessible from the back panel for ease of servicing. Despite its 15 watts, the MT 15 sounds more like 50, so a half power switch that takes the MT to 7 watts is a welcome addition. Bottom line, the amount of features, the hugeness of the sound, and the raw horsepower of the circuit make the MT 15 an impressive lunchbox hero.

Your volume control will operate with unprecedented smoothness, allowing you to milk useful sounds out of your guitar, even at low settings. To call these pickups noiseless would be a grand understatement!

The Fluence Modern Humbucker Alnico pickup s first voice is reminiscent of a modern active pickup. Plug into your amp and treat yourself to that familiar modern active pickup with a full, boosted sound and killer articulation and dynamics. The second voice is an exclusive Fluence sound with a clean, crisp, and fluid tone without any mush. Don t worry, both voices deliver the unmistakable humbucker sound! The voices can be accessed by any number of standard switches or push pull controls and can be added as a completely reversible modification to most guitars. Power supply delivers 200+ hours of use Offering 200+ hours of playing time, Fishman Fluence Modern Alnico pickups also fully recharge in a matter of a few hours by using a standard USB charger.

Bobri was well respected for his artistry and collaboration with the masters of his time, including Andres Segovia and Ida Presti. Bobri also authored well respected study guides, including The Complete Study Of The Tremolo that is still used today. Bobri had an idea to mute the strings on a classical guitar to help focus on improving technique. He rolled Hanes stockings and wedged them in front of the bridge. To simplify and improve on the overall idea, Rosette now offers an affordable tool for tremolo improvement, the TremoloMute. New! From Rosette, the TremoloMute tremolo and arpeggio practice tool adds a new dimension to the goal of mastering tremolo and arpeggio. TremoloMute safely damps string vibration just enough to allow you to focus on how you approach string contact, including how your nails and fingertips make when striking the strings. Tremolo Mute decreases string movement, adding a sensation of increased resistance. Use TemoloMute twice through your exercise music piece, then remove it and play again. The contrast is invigorating and you will improve your accuracy and tone. You actually learn to use less effort to produce a smoother tremolo.. Use the TremoloMute as part of your study regimen and you will notice considerable improvement in your progress. TremoloMute slides quickly under your guitar strings and rests right in front of the bridge. The multi-layered material is safe for any guitar finish. The closed cell top strip adjusts to your string height. It has a hollow core that allows just the right amount of contact against the strings. This is a simple but incredible practice tool, and it should be in every classical guitar case! Instructions and study guide included.
