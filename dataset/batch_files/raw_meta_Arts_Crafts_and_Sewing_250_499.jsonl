This machine is designed with the upper wing with the receding angle and the lower wing not attached with the receding angle at all, it is a fuselage structure with a wing covering structure on the frame with mixed wooden gold. At that time, it was said to have kinetic performance comparable to that of the ninety-six warships, it was used for bombing missions, raising battle results in air battle as well as searching for enemies and reconnaissance. It was operated as a deployment to the ground base and as a machine on which numerous ship ships including Battleship Nagato were installed. The kit carefully designs the unique texture of the airframe. The division of the trunk and lower wing accurately reproduces the shape by molding the upper half of the fillet into separate parts and molding the lower half to the main wing side. Ribs are provided inside the upper wing and lower wing parts to ensure strength after assembly. Cowling is reproduced in 3 divisions as with the actual machine. The main float is divided up and down. The ladder of the vertical stabilizer is made separate parts. Regarding horizontal tail wings, it is designed based on newly acquired materials.

Unison pastels are the creation of artist John Hersey. From a converted coachhouse in Northumberland, England, John and a small band of artisans lovingly make Unison pastels by hand, cutting no corners, accepting no compromise. They make small batches of 100 to 200 pastels at a time. Each stick is hand rolled and allowed to air dry. This produces a soft pastel which is eager to embrace the tooth of your drawing paper. There is a richness, a smoothness, an intensity you will find nowhere else. John Hersey developed Unisons color scheme in unified cycles of 18 colors. He observed from nature that a single color takes on endless variations of hue, depending on the quality of light that strikes it. After 15 years of experimentation, his pastels reflect the true nature of color. They have a color scheme that flows from nature itself, seducing the eye with its power. Unison pastels are a work of art themselves! One of our customers actually gets tears in her eyes looking through the Unison colors, and she says these are just so incredibly beautiful, my heart races when I see the endless array of color.
