In the 1950s, he worked in the K. Zilcan factory in Istanbul. At the age of nine Mehmet Tamdeer started to work for Mikhail Zilcan. Mikhail Zilcan and Kirkor Kkyan taught him every aspect of this ancient Turkish art, based on a history that stems back to the early 17th century. The Istanbul brand name was adopted by a cymbal works established by two cymbal smiths, Mehmet Tamdeger and Agop Tomurcuk. At that time, they had over three decades of cymbal making experience. Mehmet and Agop named their company after the city that has been home to the epitome of high quality cymbals for many, many years Istanbul. These cymbals were first exported to the U.S. in 1984, first under the name Zildjiler , and soon afterwards as Istanbul . Both craftsmen signed each cymbal and many of these cymbals are now collectors items. After Agop Tomurcuk s unexpected death in July 1996, Mehmet decided to continue the production of cymbals under his own name, stanbul Mehmet. A lot has changed since then, but his belief in the richness and the character of a handmade cymbal will always remain. Machines don t have ears. That s why we continue to make our cymbals according to the ancient tradition - with an open eye towards the music that s being made now, and in the future.\\nItem Weight 4 Pounds\\nProduct Dimensions 17 x 17 x 1 inches\\nBest Sellers Rank Musical Instruments 118822, Crash Cymbals 332 \\nIs Discontinued By Manufacturer No\\nDate First Available April 1, 2014\\nSize -inch\\nBrand Istanbul Mehmet Cymbals\\nModel Name CT17\\nItem Dimensions LxWxH 17 x 17 x 1 inches\\nIncluded Components not included\", \"price\": 220.04, \"summary\": null}"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

With the RKS30X You will not have to sit there turning a knob like with conventional X stands. With this one, you hit a button and you can adjust the height of the stand quickly and easily. This mechanism is actually also way more sturdy than the older technology. Most X stands have square shaped tubes. The Rockville RKS30X has circular tubes. Our engineers found that circular tubes are more sturdy and are stronger and more durable. These can withstand a ton of impact. The weight capacity of this model is 132 pounds. This is a conservative rating. I weigh 160 pounds pure muscle of course and I was able to lean all my body weight onto this unit with my feet totally in the air and this unit supported me easily.

The full size housing provides enough separation on your board, reducing the crowding issues associated with inexpensive mini pedals.\\nVersatile Power Indio true bypass guitar effect pedals can be powered either by a 9V battery or an external power supply, making them both versatile and venue scenario proof. Use the 611690 Stage Right 9V Power Supply for Guitar Pedals available separately when playing at home, in your practice space, or when power is easily accessible at the venue.
