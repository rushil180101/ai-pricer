SHAKE VIGOROUSLY BEFORE EACH USE!\\nBANISH is a concentrated natural organicide formulated with a diverse blend of powerful plant oils that treats the root of fungal disease with specific modes of action. Banish has a Patented Micronization process that takes these normally bulky, heavy oils and shrinks them down to less than 1 micron in size.\\nBANISH is extremely effective, both on contact and preventative control. Composed of Gerinol and Iso Alcohol. The Gerinol prevents the translocation of positive charged Potassium ions through the downy powdery mildew, which is how this fungus spreads. The micronized gerinol particles get into the vascular tissue of the plant, where the mildew s hyphae are anchored in. This kills the fungi at the source where it is anchored into the plant.\\nBANISH also creates a layer on the plant so other mildew spores cannot germinate on contact. The alcohol helps dry out the fungal layer on the surface of the plant to insure a rapid rate of death so the mildew doesn t shoot a ton of spores out before it dies. This duo is mildew s worst nightmare. The Geraniol in BANISH is the purest available, Non-GMO, We source our oils from Asia to guarantee the highest level of quality.\\nBANISH is fully registered and positioned for all sectors of agriculture. Under warm conditions, BANISH will naturally biodegrade leaving minimal to no residue. Perfect for vegetables, fruits, flowers, plants, trees, medical cannabis marijuana etc. Click Add to Cart to order BANISH now. At Supreme Growers, we believe that quality starts at the soil. Our mission is to equip growers with the knowledge and resources to make self-sustainable growing economically viable. Thats our commitment\\nCONTROLS VARIOUS DOWNY & POWDERY MILDEW PATHOGENS BANISH uses natural geranium oil plant extract as a fungicide. Mildew growth cycles begin with spore germination at the plant surface. After docking at the surface, mildew germ tubes begin to grow and feed from plant cell nutrients. The two fold prevention and healing effect works by inhibiting spore germination, germ tube growth, and by destroying the pathogen cell. Geraniol induces an unbalance of potassium K+ ions inside the mycelium and inhibits mildew spore germination and mycelium growth. It enters the pathogen cell, causing cell lyses or cell death. Dilute 4.0 mL of BANISH per 1 gallon of water. BANISH should be foliar sprayed directly onto the mildew outbreak and areas affected by powdery or downy mildew. To reduce the chance of burning, raise grow lamps and do not use directly under intense lighting. If outdoors, do not apply during peak sun, apply during the morning or evening. Apply to infected areas 2 - 4 times every 5 - 7 days apart. To prevent mildew outbreaks, apply BANISH every 14 days.\\nItem Form Liquid,Spray\\nItem Weight 8.1 Pounds\\nLiquid Volume 1 Gallons\\nBrand Supreme Growers\\nTarget Species Fungus\\nIs Discontinued By Manufacturer No\\nPackage Dimensions 11.25 x 9.25 x 7.5 inches 8.1 Pounds\\nDate First Available November 14, 2017\\nManufacturer Supreme Growers\", \"price\": 164.99, \"summary\": null}"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Whether you re an experienced professional or an amateur when it comes to home improvement, our tools are handy and accessible.\\nQuality Tool - It has an improved joint designed for tension adjustment and ensures that the tension will not change with leg movement.\\nMeets Strong Demands - Committed in providing customers with consistent and reliable solutions, Starrett has set the standard for precision, quality and innovation. Our products are long-lasting, robust with excellent service and performance.\\nThe Starrett 27-6 improved firm-joint inside caliper has a leg length of 6 150 mm but opens to approximately one-third larger than the leg length. The joint allows for tension adjustment, while the tension will not change if the legs move. The legs are made from a high-grade steel and are ruggedly constructed and well-finished.\\nCalipers measure the distance between two opposing sides of an object. They make inside, outside, depth, or step measurements, according to their type. Calipers are commonly used in architecture, metalworking, mechanical engineering, machining, manufacturing, carpentry, and medicine. The simplest calipers have two legs to mark the two points and require a ruler to take the measurement. More complex calipers use two sets of jaws instead of legs and have up to two graduated scales. Vernier, dial, and digital calipers give direct and accurate readings and are functionally identical, having a calibrated scale with a fixed jaw, and another jaw with a movable pointer that slides along the scale. The vernier caliper has a scale sliding parallel to the main scale for an additional, fractional reading to improve measurement precision. The dial caliper has a circular dial with a pointer on a toothed gear rack replacing the second vernier scale. As with the vernier, this second measurement is added to the reading from the main scale to obtain the result. The dial caliper is used also for measuring size differential between two objects. The digital caliper takes the same sort of differential measurements as the dial caliper by zeroing the display at any point along the slide, with an LCD replacing the dial that displays a single, easily read value in both English and metric units. Some digital calipers can hold data readings between measurements and send them to data collection devices.\\nThe L. S. Starrett Company was founded in 1880, originally manufacturing bench vises, squares, and other tools. They acquired other companies throughout the years, expanding their services into making precision measurement instruments and tools, such as calipers, micrometers, saw blades, and gauges. Starrett is headquartered in Athol, Massachusetts and has manufacturing facilities in Brazil, the United Kingdom, China, and other locations.\\nBrand Starrett\\nMaterial Alloy Steel\\nRange 0-6 \\nIs Discontinued By Manufacturer No\\nProduct Dimensions 7.2 x 1.3 x 1.1 inches 3.2 Ounces\\nDate First Available August 24, 2007\\nManufacturer Starrett\", \"price\": 59.65, \"summary\": null}"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This self adhesive foam bandages for wounds helps create a conducive environment for healing by keeping the wound moist and preventing bacterial contamination activity. JJ CAREs silicone dressing wound use is also non-linting which is great for conditions that require regular dressing change.\\n HIGH QUALITY MATERIALS  Why are silicone bandages better than basic gauze pads? The medical foam dressing is made up of 5 layers polyurethane film, an absorbent core, a non-woven layer, a PU pad, and the wound contact layer which is hypoallergenic silicone gel. These layers work together to create an absorbent yet breathable surface keeping the wound moist and sterile for a longer period. The adhesive foam wound dressing is also easy to fit over a wound and does not curl.\\n HIGH ABSORBENCY FOR ADVANCED HEALING  A moist wound environment helps promote fast healing. The breathable foam adhesive sterile dressing thoroughly absorbs and locks in large amounts of exudate while reducing wound bed maceration or the breaking down of skin due to prolonged exposure to moisture. Despite high absorbency, the material does not shred or stick to the wound which is great news for people with sensitive skin.\\n COMFORT AND PAIN RELIEF  Pain is inevitable in wound care and healing. With the help of the silicone foam dressings absorbency features, pain and even trauma is reduced. The low-friction soft material also provides comfort during movement and can be used with pressure bandage for bony parts of the body such as the knee. Its waterproof outer layer also makes it easy for the wearer to take a shower.\\n VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS The silicone foam dressing works well with mild to moderate exudate wounds such as eczema, cysts, post-operative wounds, bed sores or ulcers, first and second-degree burns, blisters, and other minor traumas. Because its highly absorbent, it is also the perfect foam dressings for wounds stages II, III and IV. These dressings are excellent for cleaning, changing, and overall wound maintenance.\\n\\nPackage Dimensions 4.96 x 4.14 x 1.34 inches 0.32 Ounces\\nDate First Available July 16, 2020\\nManufacturer JJ CARE\", \"price\": 11.89, \"summary\": null}"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The TDR time-domain reflectometer measures cable length and locates faults on virtually all types of cable including twisted pair, coaxial, and parallel conductors, finding the distance to open and short circuits in up to 3,000 of cabling. It has an adjustable VOP velocity of propagation setting to optimize the accuracy of fault location and cable length measurements. The analog tone generator sends a signal through wires for locating and tracing wires with a probe sold separately , and has five distinct SmartTone cadences for isolating individual wire pairs.

The test set has two basic modes of operation talk mode for off-hook operations including verifying dialing and receiving calls, and monitor mode for on-hook operations including checking for an idle line, listening for line noise, measuring DC voltage on the line, and capturing DTMF dual-tone multi-frequency tones to check for proper signaling. In monitor mode, the test set provides a high impedance coupling to monitor lines without disrupting service. When switching to talk mode, the data lockout feature tests the line for high-speed data signals and remains on hook and beeps if such signals are detected. The lockout can be overridden to pull dial tone from a noise line. Telephone test sets, also called butt sets, are used by telecom technicians to troubleshoot and maintain copper-wire voice-subscriber lines such as POTS plain old telephone service lines.

This makes the bolt self-locking when placed through a square hole in a metal strap, or a round hole in most wood.

They can also be used as shut off valves in low pressure or vacuum air lines. Please note that each valve size has an open and closed pressure rating. Because the plastic paddle can flex with flowing water they are not good for throttling water or trying to close the valve with fast moving water  thus the low mid flow cut off water pressure of approximately 6 pounds per square inch psi . These slide valves are sometimes referred to as knife or guillotine gate valves and are a great alternative to ball valves in low pressure applications since they are full flow, quick opening, and are generally a much lower cost especially in larger sizes. They work well with soft debris like waste but small hard debris can settle in the bottom of the valve seat slot and prevent it from closing completely. They can easily be cleaned or repaired by unbolting and replacing the seals or valve body. The handles simply unscrew for easy replacement  if you do so be sure not to damage the valve shaft. Extension rods are available for remote actuation. The Valterra 7101 gate valve has 1-1 2 Schedule 40 female slip fittings which receive 1-1 2 pipe. Black acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS body and hub fittings are resistant to corrosion and mild chemicals as are the polypropolene PP paddle and thermoplastic vulcanizate TPV seals. The valve shaft is made of 304 stainless steel. Hardware is zinc plated steel. It has a maximum pressure rating of 45 psi in the closed position, 30 psi in the open position, and a mid-flow maximum closing pressure rating of 6 psi. The maximum temperature rating is 205 degrees F 96 degrees C .
